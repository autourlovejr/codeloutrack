# SimpleServices

This website was inspired by a business venture that i started before entering the Code Lousiville course.  The objective of the website is to make booking a service through the company easier with a few clicks.  The features I have included in my website are:

1. Flexbox for a user friendly experience.
2. A javascript array that prompts users for name and income per year, then returns users name and message depending on entry.
3. A javascript loop that displays numbers 1-10 at top of page.

*4. A random number is generated in the console when the page opens.
